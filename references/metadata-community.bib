   abstract = "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
               has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
               thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
               diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
               study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
               to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
               widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
               collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
               reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
               and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
               pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
               we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
               standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
               standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
               unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
               and captures the metadata necessary for most common data
               processing operations.",
